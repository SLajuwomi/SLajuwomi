Hey, I'm Stephen. I'm currently a senior CS student just working on improving my coding skills right now.

I do some (YouTube)[https://www.youtube.com/@stephen_builds-v3n] as a hobby. 

You can also find me on (X)[https://x.com/xyzsaku_], (Instagram)[https://www.instagram.com/stephenbuilds_/], (TikTok)[https://www.tiktok.com/@stephenbuilds_], and (LinkedIn)[https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenlajuwomi/]

I like to play video games, favorite is Red Dead Redemption 2.

I also used to play the piano and violin and hopefully will get back to that someday.

Would love to make my own game someday.
